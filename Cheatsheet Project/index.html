                The value <span>absolute</span> for the CSS property position enables an element to ignore sibling elements and instead be positioned relative to its closest parent element that is positioned with relative or absolute.
                
                The value <span>relative</span> of the CSS position property enables an element to be positioned relative to where it would have originally been on a web page.

            <td>The CSS clear property specifies how an element should behave when it bumps into another element within the same containing element. The clear is usually used in combination with elements having the CSS float property. This determines on which sides floating elements are allowed to float.</td>
